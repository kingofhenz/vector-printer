# vector-printer
inputs a vector, and then prints it.
This code reads input from the user and tries to parse it as an integer using the stoi function from the string library. If stoi is able to parse the input as an integer, it adds the number to the numbers vector. If the input is not an integer, it checks if it is the string "end" and exits the loop if it is. If the input is neither an integer nor the string "end", it prints an error message and continues the loop.
